# PaFlo-definitions
Definitions for the PaFlo app

<h1>How do I write a definition list?</h1>
A definitions xml needs to be in the form of <b>vorlageDef.xml</b> (see this Repo) to be parsed correctly. 
Just 
copy the content of the form, 
find a filename, your own definitions and their explanations
and fill it in the form!

If you want to share your definitionlist with everyone, optionally add your .xml-file to this Repo. 

Afterwards, you can choose. You can either just ping on us so that we can refresh the defIndex.xml.
Or you click on the file and then on "Raw". Copy the url and then open defIndex.xml. Add your definitions list in the there shown form.

Congrats :)
Now everybody can see, download and do your quiz!
